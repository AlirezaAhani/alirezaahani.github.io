### The Silence of Judgment

Lately, I’ve been carrying a heavy weight on my shoulders—a weight that feels like it’s made of judgment, silence, and indifference. It’s not the kind of weight you can see or touch, but it’s there, pressing down on me every day. I feel like I’m constantly being judged, not just by others, but by myself.

I look around and see people living their lives, laughing, connecting, and I wonder why I can’t have that. Why do I feel so isolated, so unseen? No one *sees* me. And when they do, it feels like they’re looking at me through a lens of judgment, picking apart every flaw, every mistake, every imperfection.

### The Voice in My Head

The voice in my head is relentless. It tells me I’m not good enough, that I’ll never be good enough. It whispers that I’m useless, worthless, a burden to those around me. And sometimes, I believe it. I *am* all those things. I don’t deserve love or kindness or understanding.

### The Mask I Wear

I wear a mask every day. It’s a mask of smiles, of pretending that everything is okay. Under the mask, I’m breaking. And I’m terrified that one day, the mask will slip, and everyone will see the truth—that I’m not as strong as I pretend to be, that I’m not as okay as I seem.

I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, afraid that one wrong move, one wrong word, will shatter the fragile illusion I’ve created. I’m afraid that if people see the real me, they’ll turn away.

### The Need for Connection

What I want more than anything is to feel connected, to feel like I belong. I want to feel loved, not for the mask I wear, but for who I really am. I want to feel like I matter, like my presence in this world means something.
